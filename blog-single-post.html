                    Invisinet joined the governments <a href:"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/uk-digital-inclusion-charter">Digital Inclusion Charter in 2015</a> . Rob Lindsay of Invisinet said "The strategy looks to reduce the amount of people in the UK who are currently excluded from online services. We decided to do our bit and help just a few of the millions of people in the UK who lack basic digital skills and capabilities, but we were determined to keep it friendly. Without access, skills, motivation and trust people will continue to be digitally excluded, with a real social and human impact; affecting job prospects, health, education and more.  We hope our coffee mornings in February will be a huge success and look forward to running more in March and April."
